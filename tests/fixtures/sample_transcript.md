## User
Can you help me implement a user authentication system?

## Assistant
I'll help you implement a user authentication system with JWT tokens. Let me break this down into steps:

1. First, I'll set up the database models for users
2. Then implement password hashing
3. Create login/logout endpoints
4. Add JWT token generation and validation

Let me start by creating the User model...

## Assistant
I've successfully implemented the following features:
- User model with password hashing (bcrypt)
- JWT token generation and refresh
- Login/logout endpoints
- Protected route middleware
- Token expiration handling

The authentication system is now ready for testing.

## User
Excellent! Let's test the login functionality.

## Assistant
Running the test suite now...
