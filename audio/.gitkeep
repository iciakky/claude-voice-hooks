# Audio Directory Structure (Directory-Driven Architecture)
#
# This directory does NOT contain audio files in version control.
# You MUST provide your own audio files.
#
# Directory structure:
# audio/
# ├── completion/       (place .wav or .mp3 files here)
# ├── failure/          (place .wav or .mp3 files here)
# ├── authorization/    (place .wav or .mp3 files here)
# └── fallback.wav      (REQUIRED - used when intent dirs are empty)
#
# Minimum requirement: audio/fallback.wav
#
# See AUDIO_SETUP.md for detailed setup instructions.
